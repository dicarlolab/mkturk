# Parameters

## TASK (**Bold** = important params)
**Agent:** Subject name

**Automator:** Boolean on/off

**AutomatorFilePath:** File path to params for the automator curriculum.

**BackgroundColor2D:** specify the background color in hex (eg, #FFFFFF for white or #000000 for black). Not required in param file. If not provided, defaults to gray screen background (#7F7F7F)

**CalibrateEye:** If >0, will calibrate for TASK.CalibrateEye number of trials for train & same number for test. Afte test, saves calibration in firestore collection "eyecalibrations." Requires FLAGS.trackeye>0.

*CheckRFID: Time in milliseconds over which at least one matching RFID read is required so that agent doesn't get kicked off of task. If there is a read within the last CheckRFID ms, task continues, otherwise agent is locked out at start of next trial. CheckRFID <= 0 turns off RFID checking.

**ChoiceGridIndex:** For a same-different task, need to specify two locations, one for same choice (circle) and one for different choice (square).

**ChoiceSizeInches:** Size of choice circle and square in physical inches on the screen

**ChoiceTimeOut:** Time in milliseconds that subject has to make a choice in AFC task before trial aborts and new sample is displayed. This timeout applies to test response screen in SR2 or M2S and to choice response screen in same-different

**ConsecutiveHitsITI:** Maximum time in milliseconds allowed to elapse from the previous trial for the current trial to count toward reward accumulation for a string of correct responses. For example, if ConsecutiveHitsITI=8000, then subject has 8 seconds to complete the next trial successfully and the consecutivehits counter will be incremented. Otherwise, the number of consecutivehits will get set to 0

**CurrentAutomatorStage:** index of current training stage of automator.

**DragtoRespond:** Flag tht specifies whether a continuous move (drag) into a choice box is allowed (DragtoRespond=1) versus a discrete click in the box (DragtoRespond=0). Defaults to 0 (click to respond) if not provided.

**FixationDotSizeInches:** Width of fixation dot. Generally smaller than Fixation(Sample)SizeInches. If >0, overlays small fixation square on both fixation & sample screens.

**FixationDuration:** How long subject has to hold fixation touch in milliseconds for a successful fixation to register.

**FixationGridIndex:** Index on the grid where the fixation image will appear. If FixationGridIncex<0, then fixation image is presented at a randomly selected grid point and the fixation position is redrawn every FixationTimeOut milliseconds. FixationMove > 0 can be used to train subjects to touch different screen locations or to calibrate an eyetrackers.

**FixationSizeInches:** Size of fixation dot or image (ie FixationUsesSample=1) in physical inches on the screen

**FixationTimeOut:** Time in milliseconds that subject has to acquire fixation before fixation dot or image extinguishes. If fixation times out, then it is just re-displayed (flashes) and no reward or punishment is administered (ie, trial is aborted)

**FixationUsesSample:** FixationUsesSample=0, a fixation circle is shown for subject to touch; FixationUsesSample=1, sample image is shown as the fixation image. This allows implementation of a trianing strategy where the subject has to engage the sample image nfixations number of times before the choice screen.

**FixationWindowInches:** Width of box within which subject has to hold fixation during fixation screen and sample screen (if RSVP task). If <=0, then defaults to display element's size for the bounding box (eg, bounding box of fixation dot or sample image/object)

**GridSpacingInches:** Determines intergridpoint spacing in physical inches on screen.

**GridXOffsetInches:** Determines how much to horizontally shift grid from center in physical inches on screen. >0 => shifts rightward

**GridYOffsetInches:** Determines how much to vertically shift grid from center in physical inches on screen. >0 => shifts downward

HeadsupDisplayFraction: Vertical fraction of screen to use for displaying task stats and device outputs such as RFID detection. If not specified, default is 0% for human, 27.3% for marmoset.

**HideChoiceDistractors:** HideChoiceDistractors=1, hides the same or different button so that subject sees only the correct one to touch. Still gets punished if touches blank area where the incorrect button would have been. This only applies to same-different choice screen. See HideTestDistractors for test response screen used in SR2 and M2S.

**HideTestDistractors (currently inactive):** HideTestDistractors=1, hides the distractor choices so that subject only sees matching choice. Still gets punished if touches blank area where the incorrect button would have been.

Homecage: Where task was performed. 0=lab 1=subject's home

**ImageBagsSample:** List of (list of) paths, where entries at the top level are directories / imagepaths for the sample images of one group; e.g. [['/bear_images', '/dog_images'], '/face_images'] is a {bear, dog} versus face task

**ImageBagsTest:** List of (list of) paths, where entries at the top level are directories / imagepaths for the test images of one group; e.g. [['/buttons/bear_icon.png, '/buttons/dog_icon.png'], ['/buttons/face_icon1.png, '/buttons/face_icon2.png']]

ImageRewardsList: List of paths containing user-specified reward per image. Images in the image_reward_list file need to be referenced by their complete path. ImageReward values: 0=no feedback (no reward or punish for that sample image) >0=user set reward for that sample image, overrides bonus reward behavior. These can be partial lists. For images where reward is manually specified, then default bonus reward behavior is used. No corresponding list is used for test (choice) images. Instead, specify reward for a whole class by listing reward for each image in that class in ImageRewardsList.

**InterTrialInterval:** How long to wait after reward/punish is delivered before starting next trial. Only a gray screen is shown for InterTrialInterval milliseconds, followed by the fixation dot. If not specified, is set to 0 ms.

**KeepSampleON:** KeepSampleON=0, sample is presented only for sampleON milliseconds for a delayed match-to-sample, KeepSampleON=1 sample remains on during choice screen. This implements a spatial match to sample.

KeepTestON: KeepTestON=0, test is presented only for testON milliseconds, KeepTestON=1 test remains on during choice screen. This only applies to same-different task when responses are indicated on additional choice screen following test screen.

Liquid: 1=water 2=water-condensed milk 3=marshmallow slurry (4/30mL)

**NConsecutiveHitsforBonus:** How many consecutive hits subject needs for the reward amount to increase.  If NConsecutiveHitsforBonus=4, then subject will get 2x reward for correct responses on 4 consecutive trials, 3x reward for correct responses on 8 consecutive trials, up to nrewardmax times of 1x reward. This is a way to make chance on a 2AFC task be virtually < 50% since reward is jointly distributed across trials rather than independently on the current trial.

**NFixations:** Number of times fixation dot needs to be pressed to advance to the match to sample phase of the task. nfixations=1 means the subject simply has to press the fixation dot once before the sample is presented. This mode allow parametric control over fixed ratio scheduling.

**NGridPoints:** Number of display grid points in either direction. Produces square grid. 3x3 is typical. Images (fixation,sample, & test) will appear centered on one of the grid points. Grid is serially zero indexed by rows then columns. ngridpoints can be made larger to allow for more response choices to be simultaneously displayed.

**NRewardMax:** Max number of rewards that can be given for a successful trial. This caps how much extra (bonus) reward subject can get for successful completion of consecutive trials. If nrewardmax=3, then subject can get up to 3x reward for completing 3*NConsecutiveHitsforBonus consecutive trials successfully, and then would get 3x reward after that until gets a trial wrong.

**NRSVP:** Number of sample scene images to show in a single trial. Displayed at TASK.SampleON duration TASK.SampleOFF between each sample drawn according to TASK.SamplingStrategy. If TASK.NRSVP<=0, only a single sample scene render will be shown for that trial. If TASK.NRSVP>0, then no choice response is awaited & reward is automatically given at the end of the sequence.

**NRSVPMax:** Exponentially more reward pulses given for longer fixations up to NRewardMax for fixating NRSVPMax images. No reward for <NRSVP clips fixated, one reward pulse for NRSVP clips viewed, and NRewardMax pulses given for NRSVPMax.  Trial-by-Trial bonus reward for consecutive hits will be ignored if this option is on to reward more images fixated within a trial. NRSVPMax is ignored if set less than NRSVP. See TSequenceActualClip in TRIALEVENTS if want to determine which clips were fixated (-1 is registered for clip times if broke fixation). See TRIALEVENTS[NReward] to determine how many reward pulses were delivered. NOTE: If want to use bonus rewards & NRewardMax in the traditional trial-by-trial sense, then set NRSVPMax < NRSVP so that only one reward is given per NRSVP images shown and bonus is enacted based on multiple consecutive trial hits.

**NStickyResponse:** Number of times subject can choose the same location on the screen before force them out of it by placing the correct answer somewhere else (i.e. if they have response bias, then on the next trial, the correct choice is drawn somewhere away from that bias). Currently not implemented for same-different task or SR2

**NStimuliPerBagBlock:** if 0, randomly samples from all bags (interleaved design), if >0, samples N consecutive images from the same sample image bag (block design). This is equivalent to blocking the session so that training is done in object blocks rather than interleaving all objects. After N sample draws are completed for bag i, proceeds to next bag i+1 according to bag sequence specified in ImageBagsSample. When all bags have been sampled NTrialsPerBagBlock times, starts back at bag 0. Note, that in an RSVP design, if NRSVP = x and NStimuliPerBagBlock = y, then y/x consecutive trials will be from the same bag. In other words, the counting of what goes into a block is in units of images not trials.

**ObjectGridIndex:** Used for SR task. If this variable is set, then each object is tied to a particular location on the grid. ObjectGrid.length must equal objectlist.length for appropriate assignment of each object label to a grid location

Pump: 1=adafruit peristaltic 2=submersible centrifugal tcs 3=diaphragm pump tcs 4=piezoelectric 3mL takasago 5=newer diaphragm pumps tcs 6=piezoelectric 7mL takasago

**PunishTimeOut:** Time out in milliseconds for incorrect responses. Black square and incorrect sound may be presented for feedback during this time.

**RewardPer1000Trials:** Amount of liquid reward in mL for 1000 correct trials. For macaques, this is around 100mL for every 1000 correct trials.

**RewardStage:** RewardStage=0 rewards for successful fixtion and skips the choice phase of task. RewardStage=1 rewards for selecting the correct choice.

**SameDifferent:** SameDifferent > 0 indicates a Same-Different task so that last screen is a new choice screen with same (circle) and different (square) buttons. Test image extinguishes after scenedurationMS milliseconds, followed by TestOFF pause, followed by choice screen. If KeepTestON=1, then test image is on for scenedurationMS milliseconds and then remains on for choice screen

**SampleGridIndex:** Index on grid where sample image appears. SampleGridIndex=4 centers the image on a 3x3 grid, where ngridpoints=3. If SampleGridIndex<0, then sample scene appears at a randomly selected grid location unless FixationGridIndex is also <0, in which case, the sample grid index will be set to be the same as the randomly generated fixation grid index (i.e., sample scene's location is yoked to where the fixation was for that trial).

**SamplingStrategy:** Determines how sample images are drawn: uniform_with_replacement, uniform_without_replacement, sequential

**SamplePRE:** Duration in milliseconds that a gray screen is presented before the first sample image. If SamplePRE is not defined or <0, then max(100,SampleOFF) is used for the blank duration preceding the first sample

**SampleOFF:** Duration in milliseconds that a gray screen is presented after the sample image before the response screen. This implements the delay in a DMS task. SampleOFF=0, leads to no delay

Separated: 0=subject was paired with conspecific during task, 1=individual housed was separated from conspecific

Species: marmoset, macaque, or human

**TestGridIndex:** Index on grid where test images (choices) appear.

**TestOFF:** Choice screen appears TestOFF milliseconds after test image is extinguished. If TestOFF=0, then test screen does not extinguish (go to blank gray) until same-different choice screen appears. If KeepTestON=1, then test image reappears during the same-different choice screen.
